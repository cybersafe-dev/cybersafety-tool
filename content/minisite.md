    Welcome to our CYBERSAFE TOOL for SCHOOLS. This free tool provides an
    opportunity for you to self-evaluate your school’s level of cybersafety
    against best practice. We survey a cross-section of School Leadership,
    Teachers and Pupils and will provide you with a report of your results,
    along with recommendations on how to further develop online safety and
    digital literacy within your school community. 


    After receiving the report you can purchase an award badge for your school from CyberSafeIreland to display your school’s commitment to online safety. We have 3 levels of award for schools: CyberChampion, CyberSmart and CyberStarter. This virtual badge can be used for two years on your school website, social media channels and all school communications. If you want to try and aim for a higher award for your school, the tool can be used again for free after 6 months, once you have made changes based on the recommendations in the report.

    Schools today are increasingly connected places in which children’s early
    relationships with both one other and technology are formed. As an
    organisation, CyberSafeIreland recognises the need for mandatory online
    safety education in schools across Ireland. This will allow pupils, teachers
    and schools to not only enjoy the positive and transformative impact of
    educational technology but also better protect themselves against the risks
    and dangers inherent in the online world.  


    While we continue to call for online safety to become a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools, CyberSafeIreland has developed CYBERSAFE TOOL for SCHOOLS, an online self-assessment tool for measuring school’s understanding of cybersafety against a number of key performance categories. Our goal is to establish a national benchmark for online safety and digital literacy across primary schools in Ireland.

    CyberSafeIreland is a not-for-profit organisation, established in 2015, that
    works to empower children, parents and teachers to navigate the online world
    in a safe and responsible manner. 


    We want our children to be able to embrace the opportunities for learning and enjoyment that technology can deliver, but we recognise that as parents and educators we have a responsibility to equip them with the tools to stay safe and avoid harm.
