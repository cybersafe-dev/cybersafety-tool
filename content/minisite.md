    Schools today are increasingly connected places and are often where kids’
    early relationships with one other and with tech are formed. Technology
    plays an increasing role in these interactions but it comes with certain
    risks and uncertainties that can’t always be easily spotted.


    Parents are often aware of their children’s use of tech and their online interactions, but it is useful for schools to be aware of their level of cybersafety as well. This helps to protect children, schools and teachers from the risks and pitfalls of online life.


    We at CybersafeIreland have created a system for measuring a school’s cybersafety against a number of categories. Our self-assessment tool will allow meaningful answers from your staff and pupils to form a report and advice on where and how you could improve.

    CyberSafeIreland is a not-for-profit organisation that works to empower
    children, parents and teachers to navigate the online world in a safe and
    responsible manner.


    We want our children to be able to embrace the opportunities for learning and enjoyment that technology can deliver, but we recognise that as parents and educators we have a responsibility to equip them with the tools to stay safe and avoid harm.


    We believe that everybody can play a role in keeping children safe online, including children themselves. Education is a key part of the solution and both schools and parents have a vital role to play in supporting children to be safe online.
