    CyberSafe Tool for Schools is a free online tool. It is an opportunity for you to self-evaluate your school’s level of cybersafety against best practice.
    
    Once you click on the ‘Get Started’ button at the top, you will be asked to register by email, and you’re good to go! Relative to your school size your dashboard will give you a specific number of leaders, teachers and pupils who must complete the short online survey, which takes no more than 15 minutes. Once the surveys are complete you can submit the results and we do the rest.
  awards: >-
    All schools receive a notification of their level award and a completion certificate. If you want to display your school’s commitment to online safety you can then purchase one of our two CyberSafe Tool forSchools ‘award mark’ packages. Read on for more information.

    We have 3 levels of award for schools depending on the results of the survey: CyberAware, CyberSmart and CyberChampion.
