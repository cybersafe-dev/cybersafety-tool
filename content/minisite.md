    **CyberSafe Tool for Schools** is a **free** online tool the first of its
    kind in Ireland. It offers a unique opportunity as a quick and efficient way
    to assess your school’s approach to online safety. By completing a short
    online survey you can get a clear snapshot of where your school stands on
    its online safety journey, measured against standards of best practice.


    Once you click on the ‘Get Started’ button at the top, you will be asked to register by email, and you’re good to go! Relative to your school size your dashboard will give you a specific number of leaders, teachers and pupils who must complete the short online survey, which takes **no more than 15 minutes**. Once the surveys are complete you can submit the results and we do the rest. **CyberSafe Tool for Schools** is completely free and offers the opportunity to purchase an annual digital badge to show your school's commitment to online safety.
  awards: All schools receive a notification of their **level award** and a basic
    **completion certificate**. If you want to display your school’s commitment
    to online safety you can then purchase one of our two **CyberSafe Tool for
    Schools** ‘award mark’ packages. Read on for more information of how to do
