    This tool provides an opportunity for you to evaluate your school’s level of cybersafety across a series of categories with questionnaires aimed at school Leaders, Teachers and Pupils.


    Click ‘Get started’ to fill in an expression of interest and the CyberSafeIreland team will contact you to get your school going with the tool. Contact us directly if you require more information.

    Schools today are increasingly connected places and are often where kids’
    early relationships with one other and with tech are formed. Technology
    plays an increasing role in these interactions but it comes with certain
    risks and uncertainties that can’t always be easily spotted.


    Parents are often aware of their children’s use of tech and their online interactions, but it is useful for schools to be aware of their level of cybersafety as well. This helps to protect children, schools and teachers from the risks and pitfalls of online life.


    We at CyberSafeIreland have created a system for measuring a school’s cybersafety against a number of categories. Our self-assessment tool will allow meaningful answers from your staff and pupils to form a report and advice on where and how you could improve.

    CyberSafeIreland is a not-for-profit organisation, established in 2015, that
    works to empower children, parents and teachers to navigate the online world
    in a safe and responsible manner. 


    We want our children to be able to embrace the opportunities for learning and enjoyment that technology can deliver, but we recognise that as parents and educators we have a responsibility to equip them with the tools to stay safe and avoid harm.
