    **CyberSafe Tool for Schools** is a **free** online tool and the **first
    solution of its kind** in Ireland. It offers a unique opportunity as a quick
    and efficient way to assess your school’s approach to online safety. By
    completing a short online survey you can get a clear snapshot of where your
    school stands on its online safety journey, measured against standards of
    best practice.

Relative to your school size your dashboard will give you a specific number of leaders, teachers and pupils who must complete the short online survey, which takes approximately **10 minutes**. Once the surveys are complete you can submit the results and we do the rest.
